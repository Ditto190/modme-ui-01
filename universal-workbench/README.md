# Universal Workbench

Welcome to your **Universal Workbench**! This environment is designed to be your go-to place for editing code, experimenting with tools, and learning, compatible with GitHub Codespaces.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### In GitHub Codespaces

1. Push this folder to a GitHub repository.
2. Click the **Code** button on GitHub and select **Codespaces**.
3. Create a new codespace. It will automatically load with all the tools you need!

### In VS Code Desktop

1. Make sure you have Docker installed and the "Dev Containers" extension.
2. Open this folder.
3. Click the pop-up (or press F1 and search) to **"Reopen in Container"**.

## 🛠 Features (Vibe Coding Ready)

This workbench comes pre-loaded with:

- **Languages**: Python, Node.js, Go, Java, C++, and more.
- **Tools**: GitHub CLI, Docker, and useful VS Code extensions.
- **Extensions**:
  - **ErrorLens**: Highlights errors directly in your code so you can't miss them.
  - **Prettier**: Automatically formats your code when you save.
  - **Code Runner**: Run code snippets effortlessly.

## 🧪 Experiments

Use the `experiments` folder to create new sub-folders for your different projects.
For example, create `experiments/my-first-tool` and start coding!

## 💡 Tips for Beginners

- **Just start typing**: The environment handles the "boring stuff" like installing languages.
- **Watch for Red**: If ErrorLens highlights a line in red, check the message—it's trying to help!
- **Run it**: Use the "Run Code" button (play icon) or terminal to execute your scripts.

Happy Coding!
