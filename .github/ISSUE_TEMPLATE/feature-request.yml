        ## ✨ Feature Request
        
        Thanks for helping improve the ModMe GenUI Workbench!

      label: Problem Statement
      description: What problem does this feature solve?
      placeholder: |
        Example: "Currently, there's no way to render nested UI elements within components. Users can't create complex dashboards with cards containing sub-components."
    validations:
      required: true

    id: solution
    attributes:
      label: Proposed Solution
      description: How would you like to solve this problem?
      placeholder: |
        Example: "Add support for a 'children' prop in component schemas, allowing agent to nest elements:
        
        ```python
        upsert_ui_element(
          id='dashboard',
          type='Container',
          props={
            'layout': 'grid',
            'children': [
              {'type': 'StatCard', 'props': {...}},
              {'type': 'ChartCard', 'props': {...}}
            ]
          }
        )
        ```

    id: alternatives
    attributes:
      label: Alternative Solutions
      description: Have you considered other approaches?
      placeholder: |
        Example: "Alternatively, could use a layout manager component that references elements by ID rather than nesting"

  - type: textarea
    id: use-cases
    attributes:
      label: Use Cases
      description: Describe concrete scenarios where this feature would be useful
      placeholder: |
        1. **Complex Dashboards**: Build multi-level dashboards with sections containing multiple widgets
        2. **Grouped Components**: Create logically grouped UI elements (e.g., "Revenue Metrics" section with 3 stat cards)
        3. **Conditional Rendering**: Show/hide child elements based on user interactions

        - Which files would need changes?
        - Any breaking changes?
        - Dependencies needed?
        - Testing considerations?
      placeholder: |
        **Files to modify:**
        - `agent/main.py`: Update upsert_ui_element validation
        - `src/lib/types.ts`: Add children to UIElement interface
        - `src/app/page.tsx`: Recursive rendering in renderElement()
        
        **Breaking changes:** None (backward compatible with props.children=undefined)
