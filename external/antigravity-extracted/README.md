## What is this?

Google Antigravity is the first "Agent-first" IDE, powered by Gemini 3. It changes how we code, moving from writing syntax to orchestrating agents.

**Awesome Antigravity** is a community-driven project to document the best configurations, prompts, and workflows to help you master this new tool without burning through your rate limits.
